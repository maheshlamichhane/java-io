FileWriter Class:-> we can use filewriter to write character data to the file.

Constructor:-> 
FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(String filename)
FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(File f) 
FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(String filename,boolean append)
FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(File f,boolean append)

 Note:-> if the specified file is not already available then all above constructors will create that file.
 
 Methods:->
 write(int ch) to write single character to a file
 write(char[] ch) to write an array of characters
 write(String s) to write string to the file
 flush() to give the gurantee that total data including last character will be returned to the file.
