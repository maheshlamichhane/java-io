PrintWriter:->
-> it is the most enhanced writer to write character data to the file.
-> the main advantage of printwriter over file writer and buffer writer is we can writer
any type of primitive data directly to the file.

Constructors:-> 
PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(String filename)
PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(File f)
PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(Writer w)

Note: PrintWriter can communicate directly with the file and can communicate
via some writer objects also.

Methods:->
write(int ch)
write(String s)
write(char[] ch)
flush()
close() 

print(char ch)
print(int i)
print(double d)
print(boolean b)
