File Class-------------------------------->

File file = new File("abc.txt") -> this line won't create any physical file first it will check is 
there any physical file named with abc.txt is available or not.if it is available then f simply refers
that file.if it is not available then we are just creating java file object to represent the name 
abc.txt.

Note: in UNIX everything is treated as a file. java file io concept is implemented based on UNIX 
operating system.hence java file object can be used to represent both files and directories.

Constructors:->
File f = new File(String name)
-> creates a java file object to represent name of the file or directory in current working
directory.

File f = new File(String directory,String name)
-> creates a java file object to represent name of the file or directory present in 
specified subdirectory.
File f = new File(File subdir, String name)


Improtant Methods Present in File class:->
boolean exists() returns true if the specified file or directory available.
boolean createNewFile() first this method will check whether the specified file
is aready available or not.if it is already available then this method returns false
without creating any physical file.if the file is not already available then this mehtod will creates 
a new file and returns true.
boolean mkdir() same as createfile method mechanism.
boolean isFile() returns true if the specified file object pointing to physical file.
boolean isDirectory() returns true if the specified file object pointing to physical directory.
