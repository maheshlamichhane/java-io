Serialization:-> The process of writing state of an object to a file is called serialization.but strictly speaking
it is the process of converting an object from java supported form into either file supported form or network
supported form.
by using fileoutputstream and objectoutputstream classes we can implement serialization.

Deserialization:-> The process of reading state of an object from a file is called deserialization.but strictly 
speaking it is the process of converting an object from either file supported form or network supported form into
java supported form.
by using fileinputstream and objectinputstream classes we can implement deserialization.

Note: we can seialize only serializable objects.an object is said to be serializable if and only if the corresponding
implements serializable interface.serializable interface presents in java.io package and it doesn't contain any 
methods.it is a marker interface.
if we are trying to serialize non-serializable object then we will get runtime exception saying notserializable
exception.

Transient Keyword:-> transient modifier applicable only for variable but not for methods and classes.
