BufferedWriter:-> we can use bufferwriter to write character data to the file.

Constructors:->
BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(Writer w ) 
BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(Writer w,int buffersize)

Note:- BufferedWriter can't communicate directly with the file it can communicate
via some Writer object. 
also valid:->
 BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("abc.txt"))
 BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("abc.txt")))
 
 Methods:->  
 write(int ch)
 write(char[] ch)
 write(String s)
 flush()
 close()  
 newLine()
 
 Note:-> whenever we are closing bufferedwriter automatically internal file writer
 will be closed and we are not required to close explictly.
 
  
  BufferedReader:-> we can use bufferreader to read character data from the file.the main
  advantage of bufferreader when compared with filereader is we can read data line by line 
  in addition to character by character.
