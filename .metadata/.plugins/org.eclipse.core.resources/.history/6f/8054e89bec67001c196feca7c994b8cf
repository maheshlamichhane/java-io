File Class-------------------------------->

File file = new File("abc.txt") -> this line won't create any physical file first it will check is 
there any physical file named with abc.txt is available or not.if it is available then f simply refers
that file.if it is not available then we are just creating java file object to represent the name 
abc.txt.

Note: in UNIX everything is treated as a file. java file io concept is implemented based on UNIX 
operating system.hence java file object can be used to represent both files and directories.
