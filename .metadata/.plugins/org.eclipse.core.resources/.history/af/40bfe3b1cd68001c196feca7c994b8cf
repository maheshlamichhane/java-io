Serialization:-> The process of writing state of an object to a file is called serialization.but strictly speaking
it is the process of converting an object from java supported form into either file supported form or network
supported form.
by using fileoutputstream and objectoutputstream classes we can implement serialization.

Deserialization:-> The process of reading state of an object from a file is called deserialization.but strictly 
speaking it is the process of converting an object from either file supported form or network supported form into
java supported form.
by using fileinputstream and objectinputstream classes we can implement deserialization.

Note: we can seialize only serializable objects.an object is said to be serializable if and only if the corresponding
implements serializable interface.serializable interface presents in java.io package and it doesn't contain any 
methods.it is a marker interface.
if we are trying to serialize non-serializable object then we will get runtime exception saying notserializable
exception.

Transient Keyword:-> transient modifier applicable only for variable but not for methods and classes.at the time of
serialization if we don't want to save the value of a particular variable to meet security constraints then we
should declare that varible as transient.
while performing serialization JVM ignores orginal value of transient variable and save default value to the file.
hence transient means not to serialize.

transient vs static:-> static variable won't participate in transient.static variable is not part of object state
and hence it won't participate in serialization.due to this declaring static variable as transient there is no use.

final vs transient:-> final variables will be participated in serialization directly by the value hence declaring a
final variable as transient there is no impact.

Note:-> if multiple objects are serialized into a single file then those objects can be deserialize on the order
they are serialized means first objects get deserialize first and last object deserialize at last.

we can serialize any no of objects to the file but in which order we serialized in the same order only we have to 
deserialize that is order of objects is important in serialization.
if we don't know order of objects in serialization.


Object Graph Serialization:-> whenever we are serializing an object,the set of all objects which are reachable 
from that objects will be serialized automatically. this group of objeccts is nothing but object graph.
