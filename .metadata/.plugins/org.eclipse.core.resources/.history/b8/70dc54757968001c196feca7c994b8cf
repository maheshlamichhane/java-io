PrintWriter:->
-> it is the most enhanced writer to write character data to the file.
-> the main advantage of printwriter over file writer and buffer writer is we can writer
any type of primitive data directly to the file.

Constructors:-> 
PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(String filename)
PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(File f)
PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(Writer w)
