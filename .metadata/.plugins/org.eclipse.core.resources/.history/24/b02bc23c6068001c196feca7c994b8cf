BufferedWriter:-> we can use bufferwriter to write character data to the file.

Constructors:->
BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(Writer w ) 
BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(Writer w,int buffersize)

Note:- BufferedWriter can't communicate directly with the file it can communicate
via some Writer object.
