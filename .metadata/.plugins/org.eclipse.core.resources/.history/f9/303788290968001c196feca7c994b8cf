FileWriter Class:-> we can use filewriter to write character data to the file.

Constructor:-> 
FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(String filename)
FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(File f) 
FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(String filename,boolean append)
FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(File f,boolean append)

 Note:-> if the specified file is not already available then all above constructors will create that file.
 
 Methods:->
 write(int ch) to write single character to a file
 write(char[] ch) to write an array of characters
 write(String s) to write string to the file
 flush() to give the gurantee that total data including last character will be returned to the file.
 close() to close the writer
 
 Note:- the main problem with the file writer is we have to insert line-seperator \n manually which is varied from
 system to system.it is difficuti to the programmer.we can solve this problem by using BufferedWriter and PrintWriter
 classes.
