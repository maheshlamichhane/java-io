FileWriter Class:-> we can use filewriter to write character data to the file.

Constructor:-> 
FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(String filename)
FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(File f) 
FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(String filename,boolean append)
FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(File f,boolean append)

 Note:-> if the specified file is not already available then all above constructors will create that file.
 
 Methods:->
 write(int ch) to write single character to a file
 write(char[] ch) to write an array of characters
 write(String s) to write string to the file
 flush() to give the gurantee that total data including last character will be returned to the file.
 close() to close the writer
 
 Note:- the main problem with the file writer is we have to insert line-seperator \n manually which is varied from
 system to system.it is difficuti to the programmer.we can solve this problem by using BufferedWriter and PrintWriter
 classes.
 
 FileReader Class:->  We can use file reader to read character data from the file.

Constructor:-
FileReader fr = new FileReader(String name)
FileReader fr = new FileReader(File f)

Methods:->
int read()
int read(char[] ch) it reads ch array.it attempts to read n of characters into char array and returns no of characters
copied from the file.
void close()

Note:-> by using filereader we can read data character by character which is not convenient to the programmer.

Usage of filereader and filewriter is not recomended because 
-> while writing data by file writer we have to insert lines seperator(\n) manually which is varied from system to system.
it is difficult to the programmer.
-> by using file reader we can read data character by character, which is not convinient to the programmer.

to overcome these problems we should go for BufferedWriter and BufferedReader.
