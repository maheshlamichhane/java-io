FileReader Class:->  We can use file reader to read character data from the file.

Constructor:-
FileReader fr = new FileReader(String name)
FileReader fr = new FileReader(File f)

Methods:->
int read()
int read(char[] ch) it reads ch array.it attempts to read n of characters into char array and returns no of characters
copied from the file.
void close()

Note:-> by using filereader we can read data character by character which is not convenient to the programmer.

Usage of filereader and filewriter is not recomended because 
-> while writing data by file writer we have to insert lines seperator(\n) manually which is varied from system to system.
it is difficult to the programmer.
-> by using file reader we can read data character by character, which is not convinient to the programmer.

to overcome these problems we should go for BufferedWriter and BufferedReader.
